👋 Hi, I’m @DarinaStoyanova
🚀 Passionate about problem-solving and exploring the world of programming.  
💡 Currently learning **Python** and looking for ways to apply it to my long-time passion—**SEO**, or not 🤷‍♀️.    
🎯 My goal? To build cool projects that make life easier and sharpen my coding skills along the way.  
🌱 Lately, I’ve been hooked on discovering and exploring new skills! 
⚡ Fun fact: I love the feeling of cracking a tough problem—it's like solving a puzzle where the pieces finally fit!
