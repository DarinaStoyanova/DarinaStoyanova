ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DarinaStoyanova
ðŸš€ Passionate about problem-solving and exploring the world of programming.  
ðŸ’¡ Currently learning **Python** and looking for ways to apply it. I truly hope that a company will see my potential and give me a chance â€” there is nothing I'm more motivated to do right now than to grow as a programmer.
